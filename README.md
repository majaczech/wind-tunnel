Small scale wind tunnels have proven effective tools for calibrating pressure difference and velocity measurement equipment. Wind tunnels however are usually expensive, challenging to build and a variety of equipment could be required. Current study focuses on constructing a comparatively inexpensive and relatively easy to build wind tunnel that can be used for calibrating velocity measurement instruments and live data logging. As a case study, calibration of a robust bi-directional velocity probes for measuring hot gas velocity is presented. Fusion360 software was used for the wind tunnel components design and additional improvements were made in TINKERCAD. The construction and all parts were printed on a Prusa MK3s 3D printer. Resolution of the printer was set to 0.3 mm with PET-G filament which provides great durability, strength, and handling of the final product. An Arduino Uno electronic platform is used to build the control unit with a capacity to measure a velocity ranging from 0 m/s to 5 m/s is used to calibrate a Rev.P hot-wire anemometer. This paper also includes the .STL files and codes for Arduino allowing control of the tunnel. It is worth noticing that in order to safely built and operate the testing apparatus, experience with Arduino platform is required and supervision from a qualified electric engineering professional.
